In recent years, access to media has undergone a transformation as mobile devices (e.g., smartphones and tablets) now allow families to provide their child with screen time opportunities throughout the day. Indeed, smartphone and tablet ownership has increased dramatically in the past five years (Pew Research Center, 2014). Some parents nowadays allows their children to use gadgets while they are doing household chores or when they are not at home (e.g., working), therefore they were not able to properly monitor the children\'s activities on their gadgets. The application can access and take control of the children\'s phone to be able to monitor the app usage, and determine the time that the children are spending in the current day. The application can also take control of the phone to turn on parental control features such as to disable certain application and it\'s notification for a certain amount of time, as well as tum off the target\'s phone.', '2022', 'Kenneth martinez', 'Information Technology', 'uploads/431151347_726386732647530_1186541395350408673_n.jpg', 'Mobile application');

Visbe, Paulo A.', 'Thesis is the report should be made by final year students in thc Faculty of Collegc of Engineering Architecture and Technology (CEAT), Rizal Technological University. There are two types of thesis report namely research and technical. Each thesis report must be bound kept in the thesis room. The thesis then will use as a general reference thesis for CEAT specially IT students. However, there are constraints in terms of the arrangement and search methods to find each thesis reports stored in the room. This will make it difficult for students to find topics that they wish to use a reference. There is also has time constraint problems faced by students and difficult for them to go into the room at every times. Safety of each thesis report also cannot be guaranteed because there is no method that can ensure the printed report or thesis project was included in the compact disc can hold out against damage or theft. Therefore, Thesis Archiving Management System was developed to help students more easily to find their desired report. Students can enter the system at every time. In addition, the safety report is also more secure as more systematic management methods in the TAMS can create data integrity in it. By using storage approach using database system, it will prove to be helpful to manage the report thesis in CEAT for their students more effectively.\r\n', '2022', 'Lea S.

Sadaya, John Carlo G.', 'In the age of technological advancement, organizations arc increasingly seeking ways to enhance their processes and services, and Rizal Technological University (RTU) is no exception. RTU strives to provide quality education and services to its students and stakeholders. However, the Technical Department of Rizal Technological University, Boni Campus, also known as the Management Information Center (MIC), faces the challenge of traditional and manual methods of tracking documents and records. These methods can be inefficient, time-consuming, and prone to errors, leading to delays, lost documents, and service delivery issues. To address these challenges and improve the quality and efficiency of services, the researchers have developed a Web-Based Document Tracking System with Cloud Server Integration. This system provides an efficient and organized approach to managing documents and records while ensuring accessibility and security. The system offers several benefits for the MIC, including easy tracking of all processed documents, the ability to create document routes, user account management, and permission settings for each account. Overall, the Web-Based Document Tracking System with Cloud Server Integration for RTU is a valuable addition to the university\'s services. It streamlines document and record tracking, making it more efficient and effective while ensuring accessibility and security. By implementing this system, RTU is better equipped to fulfill its mission of providing quality education and services.\r\n', '2023', '', 'Information Technology', 'uploads/430948682_751877360239198_3254527022649494855_n.jpg', 'Cloud Server integration, Web-based, Document Tracking System'),

Highway Hills, Mandaluyong City: An Arduino-based device for instant contact to the local medical services during the academic year 2021. The Arduino IDE was used as the software platform for programming the instructions to Arduino Nano, and MIT APP Inventor was used to construct a mobile app that can record the incoming messages from the prototype. The hardware modules that the researchers utilized was Arduino Nano, which serves as a platform for programming major instructions for the functions of other modules. Through connecting the Arduino Nano to the GSM module, which was used in the prototype, the Arduino Nano can program an instruction for the GSM module. The user of the device will be asked for their information, personal emergency contacts, phone number, and their past health complications. The administrator has the power to entertain in gathering, editing, and checking the personal information of the user. The emergency contacts, relatives of the user, and the agent will receive the SMS, while the agent is responsible to relay the emergency message to the people that will be dispatched to the scene of distress while maintaining the communication to the user.\r\n', '2021', 'Lea S.
